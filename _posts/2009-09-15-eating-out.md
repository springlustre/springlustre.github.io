<img src="//hunch.se/stuff/outofthebox.png" alt="" align="right">I eat out almost every day. Why? Because I like spending the extra money? No, of course not. What's sooo important for me in life is creative energy â€” feeling creative and actually being *creative*. Basically creativity is fed by change of context, changing your situation or environment. IMO one of the simplest and most effective ways to do this is to move around; go out for lunch, interact with different people and get into slightly different situations than you're used to.
